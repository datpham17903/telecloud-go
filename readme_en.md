</div>

**TeleCloud** is a project that allows you to use Telegram’s nearly unlimited storage capacity to store and manage files.

This project has been **completely rewritten in Golang** from the original project [dabeecao/tele-cloud](https://github.com/dabeecao/tele-cloud), delivering excellent performance, extremely low memory usage, and the ability to compile into a single executable (binary) that can run anywhere without requiring a development environment.

## 🚀 Quick Installation Guide (Using Prebuilt Binary)

This is the fastest way to run TeleCloud without installing a development environment.

### 1. System Requirements

You need to install **FFmpeg** so the system can generate thumbnails for videos and audio files.

* **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
* **Redhat-based:** `sudo yum install ffmpeg` via [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/)
* **Alpine Linux:** `apk add ffmpeg`
* **Windows:** Download a prebuilt version from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to PATH.

If FFmpeg is not installed, the project will still run, but thumbnail generation will not work.

---

### 2. Download TeleCloud

Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/dabeecao/telecloud-go/releases) section and download the appropriate version for your OS (Linux, Windows, or macOS).

---

### 3. Environment Configuration

In the directory containing the binary file, you will find a file named `env.example`. Copy it to `.env` and fill in your information:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Main fields in `.env`:

* `API_ID` & `API_HASH`: Get from [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
* `LOG_GROUP_ID`: ID of the group/channel storing files or use `me` for Saved Messages
* `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password to access the web interface
* `PORT`: Port to run the application
* `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`: Maximum upload file size (Premium accounts can go up to 4096MB)
* `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to the database file
* `THUMBS_DIR`: Directory for storing thumbnails
* `WEBDAV_ENABLED`: Enable/Disable WebDAV server (`true` or `false`)
* `WEBDAV_USER`: WebDAV username
* `WEBDAV_PASSWORD`: WebDAV password

---

#### 🔑 Get API_ID and API_HASH

* Visit: [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
* Log in with your Telegram phone number
* Select **API development tools**
* Create a new app
* Retrieve:

  * `API_ID`
  * `API_HASH`

---

#### 📡 Get LOG_GROUP_ID

* Create a Telegram group and add your Userbot (or just create a private group with yourself)
* Make sure chat history is enabled in group settings
* Add bot [@get_all_tetegram_id_bot](https://t.me/get_all_telegram_id_bot) to the group and run `/getid`

Example response:

```
🔹 CURRENT SESSION / PHIÊN HIỆN TẠI

• User ID / ID Người dùng: 36xxxxxxxx
• Chat ID / ID Trò chuyện: -100xxxxxxxxxx
• Message ID / ID Tin nhắn: x
• Chat Type / Loại hội thoại: supergroup
```

Use the **Chat ID** as your `LOG_GROUP_ID`, typically in this format:

```
-100xxxxxxxxxx
```

---

### 4. Login & Run

Open terminal in the binary directory:

**Step A: Authenticate (first time only)**

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./telecloud -auth

# Windows
telecloud.exe -auth
```

Enter your phone number, OTP, and 2FA password (if any).

---

**Step B: Start the server**

```bash
./telecloud
```

Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:8091`
WebDAV at: `http://localhost:8091/webdav`
