</div>

**TeleCloud** is a project that allows you to use Telegram’s nearly unlimited storage capacity to store and manage files.

This project has been **completely rewritten in Golang** from the original project [dabeecao/tele-cloud](https://github.com/dabeecao/tele-cloud), delivering excellent performance, extremely low memory usage, and the ability to compile into a single executable (binary) that can run anywhere without requiring a development environment.

## 🛠️ Automatic Installation (Recommended for Linux/Termux)

This is the simplest and most automated way to install, configure, and manage TeleCloud. The script automatically installs dependencies (FFmpeg, Tmux, Cloudflared...), configures the service, and provides a convenient management menu.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Using curl
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dabeecao/telecloud-go/main/auto-setup-en.sh)

# Or using wget
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dabeecao/telecloud-go/main/auto-setup-en.sh)
```
Or if you have already cloned the repository:
```bash
chmod +x auto-setup-en.sh
./auto-setup-en.sh
```

## 🚀 Quick Installation Guide (Using Prebuilt Binary)

This is the fastest way to run TeleCloud without installing a development environment.

### 1. System Requirements

You need to install **FFmpeg** so the system can generate thumbnails for videos and audio files.

* **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
* **Redhat-based:** `sudo yum install ffmpeg` via [RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/)
* **Alpine Linux:** `apk add ffmpeg`
* **Windows:** Download a prebuilt version from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to PATH.

If FFmpeg is not installed, the project will still run, but thumbnail generation will not work.

---

### 2. Download TeleCloud

Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/dabeecao/telecloud-go/releases) section and download the appropriate version for your OS (Linux, Windows, or macOS).

---

### 3. Environment Configuration

In the directory containing the binary file, you will find a file named `env.example`. Copy it to `.env` and fill in your information:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Main fields in `.env`:

* `API_ID` & `API_HASH`: Get from [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
* `LOG_GROUP_ID`: ID of the group/channel storing files or use `me` for Saved Messages
* `PORT`: Port to run the application
* `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`: Maximum upload file size (Premium accounts can go up to 4096MB)
* `DATABASE_PATH`: (Optional) Path to the database file (default: `database.db`)
* `THUMBS_DIR`: (Optional) Directory for storing thumbnails (default: `./static/thumbs`)
* `TEMP_DIR`: (Optional) Path to the temporary directory for storing file chunks during the upload process (default: `./temp`)
* `PROXY_URL`: (Optional) Proxy to connect MTProto, supports HTTP and SOCKS5 (e.g. `socks5://127.0.0.1:1080`)

---

#### 🔑 Get API_ID and API_HASH

* Visit: [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
* Log in with your Telegram phone number
* Select **API development tools**
* Create a new app
* Retrieve:

  * `API_ID`
  * `API_HASH`

---

#### 📡 Get LOG_GROUP_ID

* Create a Telegram group and add your Userbot (or just create a private group with yourself)
* Make sure chat history is enabled in group settings
* Add bot [@get_all_tetegram_id_bot](https://t.me/get_all_telegram_id_bot) to the group and run `/getid`

Example response:

```
🔹 CURRENT SESSION / PHIÊN HIỆN TẠI

• User ID / ID Người dùng: 36xxxxxxxx
• Chat ID / ID Trò chuyện: -100xxxxxxxxxx
• Message ID / ID Tin nhắn: x
• Chat Type / Loại hội thoại: supergroup
```

Use the **Chat ID** as your `LOG_GROUP_ID`, typically in this format:

```
-100xxxxxxxxxx
```

---

### 4. Login & Run

Open terminal in the binary directory:

**Step A: Authenticate (first time only)**

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./telecloud -auth

# Windows
telecloud.exe -auth
```

Enter your phone number, OTP, and 2FA password (if any).

---

**Step B: Start the server**

```bash
./telecloud
```

Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:8091`
- **On first access**, the system will prompt you to create an admin account and password.
- Other configurations like changing password and configuring **WebDAV** can be done directly in the **Settings** section of the web interface after logging in.
WebDAV at: `http://localhost:8091/webdav`

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended for Servers)

This is the recommended deployment method for servers. It makes it easy to manage, update, and run TeleCloud without worrying about the host OS environment.

### Requirements
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dabeecao/telecloud-go.git
cd telecloud-go
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the required fields:

```env
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
LOG_GROUP_ID=me
PORT=8091
```

> The `DATABASE_PATH`, `THUMBS_DIR`, and `TEMP_DIR` variables are automatically overridden by docker-compose to point inside the `./data/` volume — you **do not need** to set them when using Docker.

### 3. Authenticate your Telegram account (First time only)

You need to log in to generate the session file (`session.json`):

```bash
# Build the image first
docker compose build

# Run the interactive auth flow
docker compose run --rm telecloud /app/telecloud -auth
```

Enter your phone number, OTP, and 2FA password (if any). The `session.json` file will be saved in `./data/`.

### 4. Start the server

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Access the web interface at: `http://localhost:8091`

**On first visit**, the system will prompt you to create an admin account and password.

### Useful commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker compose stop

# Update to a new version
git pull
docker compose build
docker compose up -d

# Remove the container (data in ./data/ is preserved)
docker compose down
```

> 📁 All persistent data (database, thumbnails, temp files) is stored in the `./data/` directory on your host machine.

## 🛠️ Build from Source (For Developers)

1. Install **Golang (1.21+)**: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dabeecao/telecloud-go.git
```

3. Configure `.env` as above

5. Build UI (Tailwind CSS and download libraries):
   * Download the **Tailwind CLI** for your OS from [Tailwind CSS Releases](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest).
   * Rename the downloaded file to `tailwindcss` (or `tailwindcss.exe` on Windows) and place it in the project root.
   * Run the build command (this script will automatically download libraries like Alpine.js and Plyr):
     ```bash
     # Linux/macOS
     chmod +x build-frontend.sh
     ./build-frontend.sh

     # Windows
     build-frontend.bat
